Formed in 2001 our first project was Lynne Ramsay’s "Morvern Callar". The remit was to combine professional and street-cast actors for the ensemble — Des famously found Kathleen McDermott in Glasgow city centre.  Kathleen, who had never acted previously, went on to star in the film alongside Samantha Morton and  win a BAFTA for best newcomer. Des Hamilton Casting have continued with great success to cast via traditional channels (theatrical agents, drama schools etc) and from the street, most notably with the casting of Thomas Turgoose for "This is England". We are very proud to have worked on an eclectic mix of projects, including: "[Bronson](/films/bronson/)", "Four Lions", "Antichrist", "Tyrannosaur",  "Wuthering Heights", and Channel 4’s "Top Boy", engaging with a broad range of directors such as Nicolas Winding Refn, Amanda Boyle, Gaspar Noe, Saul Dibb, Andrea Arnold, Lone Scherfig and Lars Von Trier.

In the last 5 years the company has expanded their offices to include Casting Suites in both Glasgow and London. These include camera, lighting, and the facility to upload to our link for clients’ immediate viewing. Recent commercials include, Benito Montorio’s "Little Investor" for HSBC, Yann Demange’s "Sexual Coercion" for the Home Office, Ringan Ledwidge’s "Three Little Pigs" for The Guardian and Amanda Boyle’s "Stuff Kids Say" for NSPCC.

Very often we work with directors who like to combine non-actors with those who are professionally trained.

If you have been approached by one of our team please take this opportunity seriously and get in touch. Notable successes we’ve had from street casting include; Thomas Turgoose "This is England", Kathleen McDermott "Morvern Callar", Luke Fraser "Bullet Boy", Tom Sweet "The Childhood of A Leader". Amongst many others, who had previously never acted before.
