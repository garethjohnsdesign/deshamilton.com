    As a company, we have always been script-led, and we therefore don’t rule out potential projects based on budget, genre, previous credits etc. We are always keen to hear from smaller scale productions with a great script - so please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

  text: |-
    There are currently no permanent full-time positions available, but we do occasionally use freelancers and sometimes run paid internships.

    Typically internships run for a three-month period. Interns will enjoy valuable hands-on experience in a friendly, busy office.
